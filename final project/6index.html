      <p>Mastering C++ can seem daunting, especially due to its steep learning curve. But C++ doesn’t have to be scary. C++ is hugely beneficial, especially if you’re interested in programming video games, where C++ is considered a gold-standard language.</p>

          What is C++ used for?
      </div>

      <div class="genpurpose">
        C++ is widely used for building applications, games, animations, and web browsers, as well as accessing data in databases and developing tools like compilers and operating systems. Because C++ produces high-performance code, it is used in banking operations for trading and in airline flight control systems. Game developers like Blizzard choose C++ for its rich GUI libraries and low-level functions allowing developers to code at the hardware level. Although many languages can be useful for cybersecurity, C++ plays an especially important role.

    <div class="difference">
          Is C++ still useful to learn?
      </div>
     
      <div class="answer">
        Even though C++ is a 30-year-old programming language with a steep learning curve, it is still useful to learn. While more modern higher-level languages will allow you to build a project quicker and easier, there are some applications where the speed and efficiency you can get from C++ are in high demand. Many game developers, especially when developing 3D games, prefer to use C++ because of its performance. C++ code is also used extensively with embedded systems, where it may be the only language you can use for a lot of hardware.
