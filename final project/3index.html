      <p>JavaScript is one of the most ubiquitous programming languages on the planet, mostly because it's the backbone of interactive web applications. On top of that, JavaScript is a great language for beginners because it gives them a chance to write code that does something visual, which is exciting and helpful when you're just getting started as a programmer. Dynamic content is the hot topic in web development right now.</p>

          What is Javascript?
      </div>

      <div class="genpurpose">
        JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies â€” the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates.

          Why is Javascript Important?
      </div>
     
      <div class="answer">
        JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers.
